# ChessAgenticCoding — Requirements

Goal: A browser-based, offline-capable chess game playable against a bot, hosted via GitHub Pages and reachable by a public URL.

## 1) Scope and Users
- Single-player chess vs. built-in engine (no server).
- Runs entirely in-browser; no network required after initial load.
- Hosted on GitHub Pages from this repository.

## 2) Core Functional Requirements
- Side selection: Player chooses `White` or `Black` before starting.
- Time control: User sets a chess clock pre-game.
  - Minutes per side (e.g., 1–180 min).
  - Optional increment per move (0–30s) and/or simple delay (optional).
- Legal chess rules and move types:
  - Standard movement and captures; checks must be respected.
  - Castling (king- and queen-side), including all legality conditions.
  - En passant capture.
  - Pawn promotion (to Queen/Rook/Bishop/Knight; default Queen, with UI choice).
  - Check, checkmate, stalemate detection.
  - Draw conditions: insufficient material, 50-move rule, threefold repetition (nice-to-have if complexity is high).
- Game result handling:
  - Win/loss/draw with reason.
  - Time forfeit when a clock reaches zero.
- Bot opponent:
  - Plays legal moves for the side opposite the player.
  - Adjustable difficulty (e.g., depth/time-based levels).
  - Deterministic or near-deterministic at lower levels to feel human.
- Controls and flow:
  - New Game dialog for side selection and time control.
  - Start/Pause/Reset controls for the clock.
  - Resign and Offer Draw (accept/decline) options.
  - Optional Undo/Redo for casual play (configurable; off by default if desired).
- Save/Load:
  - Auto-save current game state and settings in localStorage.
  - Resume last game on page load.

## 3) User Interface and UX
- Chessboard UI:
  - Click-to-move and/or drag-and-drop piece movement.
  - Highlight legal target squares for selected piece; highlight last move.
  - Indicate check on the king clearly.
  - Coordinate labels (a–h, 1–8) toggle.
  - Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, mobile.
- Clocks:
  - Separate countdown clocks for both sides; active player’s clock ticks.
  - Clear low-time state (e.g., color, pulse) and timeout behavior.
- Status area:
  - Turn indicator, result banner, and brief messages (check, draw offer, etc.).
- Optional info panels:
  - Move list (SAN/PGN), current FEN, captured pieces.
- Visuals and feedback:
  - Smooth piece move animations (non-blocking).
  - Optional sounds (move, capture, check, game end) with a mute toggle.

## 4) Rules/Engine Requirements
- Legal move generation must prevent illegal self-checks.
- Performance adequate for real-time play on low-power devices.
- Bot design options (choose one):
  - In-house: Minimax + alpha-beta pruning + simple evaluation + iterative deepening + transposition table (worker-based if possible).
  - Embedded engine: WASM/JS engine (e.g., Stockfish WASM) loaded locally in the page (no network); credit and license compliance required.
- Strength levels via search depth, node/time limits, or evaluation simplifications.
- Use Web Worker(s) for engine computation to avoid blocking the UI.

## 5) Timer Requirements
- Configurable pre-game time and optional increment/delay.
- Start on first move or after user presses Start (configurable).
- Pause/resume controls that freeze both clocks.
- Clock switches when a valid move completes.
- Time expiration triggers game end with loss on time.

## 6) Data and Persistence
- LocalStorage keys for settings (theme, sounds, side, time control) and last game snapshot (FEN, move history, clocks, side to move, draw rights).
- PGN export/import (nice-to-have) for sharing/reviewing games.

## 7) Accessibility
- Keyboard-accessible controls (tab order, shortcuts for new game, pause, resign).
- ARIA roles on interactive elements; board/state announcements for screen readers.
- High-contrast theme and color-blind-friendly highlights.

## 8) Performance and Quality
- Target 60fps UI; avoid main-thread stalls (engine in Worker).
- Efficient DOM updates; throttle animations and highlights.
- Basic unit tests for rules (or rely on a well-tested rules lib).
- Perft-style validation for move generator if implementing in-house.

## 9) Technology and Structure
- Tech stack: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS or TypeScript (compiled to JS) with no server.
- No runtime network calls; assets bundled locally for GitHub Pages.
- File layout (proposed):
  - `index.html` — app shell and layout.
  - `styles/` — `main.css` (+ optional themes).
  - `src/` — `app.ts|js`, `ui/`, `engine/`, `chess/` (rules), `workers/`.
  - `assets/` — piece SVGs, sounds, icons.
  - `docs/` or root for GitHub Pages hosting.
  - `README.md` — usage, controls, build, deploy.
  - `LICENSE` — if bundling third-party engines or assets.
- Optional PWA:
  - `manifest.webmanifest` and service worker for offline caching.
  - Cache-first for core assets to enable offline after first visit.

## 10) Hosting and Deployment (GitHub Pages)
- Pages configuration: Serve from `main`/`docs` folder or `gh-pages` branch.
- Use relative paths so the app works under a project subpath.
- No build step required, or a simple pre-deploy script to copy compiled assets to `docs/`.
- Verify offline capability (if PWA) within GitHub Pages constraints.

## 11) Browser Support
- Latest Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari.
- Mobile browsers for iOS/Android (touch-based drag/click).

## 12) Non-Functional Requirements
- Privacy: No analytics or network calls by default.
- Reliability: App state recovers from refresh; engine errors are contained.
- Maintainability: Clear module boundaries (UI, rules, engine, timer, storage).

## 13) Acceptance Criteria
- Can start a new game, choose side, set time, and play to completion vs bot.
- All standard moves (incl. castling, en passant, promotion) behave correctly.
- Clocks tick for the active side, switch on move, and end games on time.
- App loads from GitHub Pages URL and plays fully offline after first load (if PWA enabled).
- No network requests during gameplay.

## 14) Nice-to-Haves (Optional)
- Multiple piece themes and board themes.
- Opening book (local JSON) for early moves, togglable.
- Analysis mode with engine suggestions (post-game or separate).
- Export/import PGN; shareable links encoding FEN and time.
- Localization support for UI strings.
